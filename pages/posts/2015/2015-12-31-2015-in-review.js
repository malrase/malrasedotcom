“2015 in Review”
date: 2015-12-31 12:00:01 -0800
<p>This year has felt busy, but I’m not sure how/why. It’s felt like my wheels have been spinning a little. I’ve been too busy to come up with a lot of items for this list – but what exactly have I been busy doing?</p>

<ol>
<li>Mad Max: Fury Road</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Star Wars: The Force Awakens</li>
<li>Inside Out</li>
</ul>
<p>Honorable mentions for It Follows and Whiplash, which I only saw this year.</p>

<p>This year, I haven’t read nearly as much as I should have. I think maybe a handful of books have been completed on my Kindle. I’m not even sure I could do a best of. Maybe I should set myself a challenge for 2016?</p>

<li>Flesh Without Blood – Grimes</li>
</ol>
