<p>The New York Times released its list of the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2015/01/11/travel/52-places-to-go-in-2015.html?hp&amp;action=click&amp;pgtype=Homepage&amp;module=photo-spot-region&amp;region=top-news&amp;WT.nav=top-news">top places to go to in 2015</a>. It puts together two of my favourite things: easy-to-digest lists and travel destinations. This year’s list was pretty exciting – among some places that we’d visited on this past trip (Manhattan, Philadelphia, and, surprisingly, Orlando), there were a lot of places I’m interested in visiting.</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singapore">Singapore</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Vincent_and_the_Grenadines">St Vincent and the Grenadines</a> in particular caught my eye. Singapore for its city-state strangeness and St Vincent for its diving. That <a href="http://graphics8.nytimes.com/newsgraphics/2015/01/08/places-to-go/assets/images/stvincent-1254.jpg">coral reef photo</a> looks so inviting! But wait.</p>
<p>Before I can plan any more, before I get too excited about a new travel destination, I go to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBT_rights_by_country_or_territory">Wikipedia page for LGBT rights by country</a>. (Or, I recently found a great site called <a href="http://equaldex.com/">Equaldex</a>. I wanted to build something similar – it has a map and an easily-searchable database of countries showing the status of various LGBT-related laws.)</p>
<p>Does that seem strange? It still does to me, even though I do it fairly regularly. But unfortunately I feel like I have to. For example, checking out <a href="http://equaldex.com/region/saint-vincent-and-the-grenadines">St Vincent and the Grenadines</a> shows me that male homosexuality is punishable by ten years in prison. I guess that takes it off the “potential diving spots” list.</p>
<p><a href="http://equaldex.com/region/singapore">Singapore</a> has a prison sentence of two years for gay guys. Another one off the list.</p>
<p>Going back to the New York Times list, there’s a couple of countries that I know are not LGBT-friendly – Oman (<a href="http://equaldex.com/region/oman">up to three years imprisonment</a>) and Morocco (<a href="http://equaldex.com/region/morocco">six months imprisonment</a>). Checking some more, there’s also St Kitts (<a href="http://equaldex.com/region/saint-kitts-and-nevis">ten years imprisonment</a>), Zimbabwe (<a href="http://equaldex.com/region/zimbabwe">up to ten years imprisonment</a>), Sri Lanka (<a href="http://equaldex.com/region/sri-lanka">up to ten years</a>), Papua New Guinea (<a href="http://equaldex.com/region/papua-new-guinea">up to fourteen years</a>), and Tanzania (a <a href="http://equaldex.com/region/tanzania"><em>minimum</em> of twenty years imprisonment</a>). That totals nine countries out of the fifty-two! I guess forty-three remaining travel destinations would still keep you pretty well-occupied.</p>
<p>That’s just going off countries that ban same-sex activities, mind you. There’s even more countries that don’t ban LGBT discrimination. When looking at destinations, I’m usually more lax with that. I mean heck, we couldn’t even <a href="http://equaldex.com/region/united-states/florida">visit Florida</a> if I included places that allow LGBT discrimination in the “no-travel” list.</p>
<p>What does this serve? Am I just being unnecessarily anxious? Is this narrowing our experience of the world over something quite small? I mean, we’re from two globally dominant countries. Surely LGBT travellers aren’t arrested that regularly? There’s a couple of high-profile cases that spring to mind – a <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/travelnews/11142952/Call-for-boycott-of-Morocco-after-British-tourist-jailed-for-homosexual-acts.html">British gay guy was arrested in Morocco</a>, and <a href="http://www.travelandescape.ca/2013/07/first-tourists-have-been-arrested-under-putins-anti-gay-laws/">four LGBT Dutch people were arrested in Russia</a>. But the number of LGBT travellers far outweighs those, surely. We’d probably be “unnoticed.”</p>
<p>As well as the “danger,” there’s also an aspect of avoiding such countries for economic reasons. We can freely choose to spend our money in, say, <a href="http://equaldex.com/region/spain">Spain</a> – which has far better equal rights for LGBT people – over another country that does not.</p>
<p>It’s weird having to read through any destination list with the knowledge that you’ll maybe have to cut out about ~15% of it. I’m interested to hear what anyone reading this – both LGBT and non-LGBT – thinks. Am I being too paranoid? Is it a valid, maybe arbitrary choice (I mean hey, it’s a useful way to narrow down <em>all possible countries</em> into a smaller list, right)? Do you have any “rules” for choosing whether you’ll visit a country?</p>
