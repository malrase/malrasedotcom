Here's a geographically inaccurate map I made to show the flights* we have taken and will be taking over the next few months. The future ones aren't set in stone, so there might be some changes towards the end of the trip.

Current airport list: SFO-IAD-JAX-PHL-CDG-VIE-CDG-AGP-LPL-STN-PRG-TXL-AMS-ARN-CDG-PHL-YYZ-JFK-MCO-JAX-SFO. In a couple of hours, we'll be on the STN-PRG leg.

*There's a couple of car/rail journeys in there too.
