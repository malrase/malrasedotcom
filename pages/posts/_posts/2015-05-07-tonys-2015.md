I had a lot of fun doing the pool for the Oscars in February. I've done a little bit more development on it to make it work for multiple awards shows.

If you go to [pool.malrase.com](http://pool.malrase.com) you can now [submit a ballot for the 2015 Tony Awards](http://pool.malrase.com/pools/2/ballots/new). This time, it's free! So although that means you won't win money, you could still win the pride of being an accurate predictor of this year's Tonys.
