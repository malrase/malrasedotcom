Before we do the North American stint of our journey, we had one final week in our favourite European city: Paris. It's amazing how quickly all anxieties about travel or business evaporate when we're sat in a café drinking some wine.

We were staying in an area new to us: [Montmartre](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montmartre). We were situated on the north side of the hill, behind the [Sacré-Cœur](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basilique_du_Sacr%C3%A9-C%C5%93ur,_Paris). It was a little tricky (but by no means impossible) to get to other areas that we usually hang out in (mostly [St Germain](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint-Germain-des-Pr%C3%A9s) and the [Latin Quarter](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_Quarter,_Paris)) – so we spent a lot of time in the neighbourhood.

One of the first things we did was walk to the Sacré-Cœur. It's something you can see from most of Paris, perched on the top of Montmartre like a wedding cake topper. Neither of us had been before, so we trekked up the few hundred steps to the top.

It's certainly a beautiful church, but the view over Paris? It's... OK.

Sure, any vista over a city is kinda nice. But there just isn't much variation to make this one that interesting. It's just roofs – and you can maybe pick out the Centre Pompidou or Notre Dame in the distance if you're lucky.

The view from the top floor of the [Centre Pompidou](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centre_Georges_Pompidou) is much better, because you can see the stereotypical Parisian apartment buildings right there, but also see the Eiffel Tower, Notre Dame, the Sacré-Cœur, etc. in the background. It's a more satisfying view. 

In short, the Sacré-Cœur looks perfectly fine from far away and I wouldn't bother climbing up all those steps unless you're really into churches.

Another touristy thing we did was the [Musée d'Orsay](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mus%C3%A9e_d%27Orsay). Housed in an old train station, it's renowned as one of the best collections of impressionist and post-impressionist art in the world. I'd visited the museum before, and didn't really enjoy it. I was in a rush and (post-)impressionism isn't really my thing. Plus the queues for tickets are notorious – I've heard stories of 2+ hours in line.

We were wandering past on a Thursday at 2pm and there was no line whatsoever for tickets. Apparently that's the time to go! On a whim, we went inside.

It's a gorgeous building, and the layout is innovative. The central aisle has sculptures and off the sides are the paintings. I must admit, I enjoyed the museum a lot more this time around. There was still a lot of stuff I didn't enjoy, but I found an appreciation for the "greats" – Monet, Cézanne, Degas, Van Gogh.

It was funny seeing the Orsay's Van Gogh collection – which completely blew away the collection of the Van Gogh Museum we visited in Amsterdam. Every classic painting is here – <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vincent_van_Gogh#mediaviewer/File:Vincent_van_Gogh_-_Self-Portrait_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg"><strong>the</strong> self-portrait</a>, [Starry Night over the Rhone](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starry_Night_Over_the_Rhone), [The Church at Auvers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Church_at_Auvers), the [less-expensive Portrait of Dr Gachet](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portrait_of_Dr._Gachet). The [plaster original of the Gates of Hell](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Gates_of_Hell) by Rodin is also there, which is probably my favourite piece in the museum. During the visit, I went from completely hating the museum to thinking it's one of my favourites in Paris.

I'd never toured [Les Invalides](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Les_Invalides), the building complex which houses the military history museum and home of Napoleon's tomb. We did that mostly to check off Parisian tourist things I hadn't yet done.

If you're super into military history, you should go. I'm... not, so the museum left me a little bored. The tomb of Napoleon was kinda cool, but that's about it. Oh, there was a sub-museum dedicated to the life of [Charles de Gaulle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_de_Gaulle). It gushed about him, which was creepy enough, but both Hampton and I thought it left a negative impression of him by the end of it. He came across as a little dictatorial, to be honest. I need to read more about his time in politics to get a better grasp of what he did.

Anyway, we mostly spent our days drinking wine and coffee in cafés, which is a fine way to spend a week. Off to Toronto (by way of one night in Philadelphia) next!
