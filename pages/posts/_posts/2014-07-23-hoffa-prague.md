<div itemprop="description">

  <p>For some reason, there's a bar in Prague named after <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimmy_Hoffa">Jimmy Hoffa</a>, the American union leader who went missing in the 70s. Unfortunately, my lack of Czech skills (and poor Google translating) don't help much with the "About" page on the <a href="http://hoffa.cz"><span itemprop="itemreviewed">Hoffa</span></a> website.</p>

  <p>First and foremost: this is a non-smoking bar! Yay! That automatically gets you points in my book. Most bars have smoking and non-smoking areas, but that's not quite the same. Location-wise, it's on a little intersection near the main train station (so great for people-watching), and has big windows. The decor is neat – they have a massive trompe-l'œil mural on one side so it looks like you're in a warehouse.</p>

  <p>They have mostly traditional drinks, with some specials on a chalkboard. The drink I had was pretty good, but nothing amazing. I went for a glass of Pimm's as it was ridiculously hot outside.</p>

  <p>They offer decent bar snacks, too. We got some tortilla chips with salsa and sour cream.</p>

  <p>We also got some hamburgers, which were amazing. They were juicy, cooked medium-rare, and had spicy-sweet secret sauce on them. Delicious!</p>

  <p>The bathroom doors were pretty neat, too.</p>

  <p><span itemprop="summary">I can see us returning to this place for its relaxed atmosphere, neat interior, and reasonably-priced decent drinks. It seemed like a nice place to call your local.</span></p>
