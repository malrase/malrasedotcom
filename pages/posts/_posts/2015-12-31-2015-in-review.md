This year has felt busy, but I'm not sure how/why. It's felt like my wheels have been spinning a little. I've been too busy to come up with a lot of items for this list – but what exactly have I been busy doing?

### Films

1. Mad Max: Fury Road
- Star Wars: The Force Awakens
- Inside Out

Honorable mentions for It Follows and Whiplash, which I only saw this year.

### TV Episodes

1. Mother's Mercy (Game of Thrones, S5 E10)
- Loplop (Fargo, S2 E8)
- Episode 6 (The Jinx, S1 E6)

### Books

This year, I haven't read nearly as much as I should have. I think maybe a handful of books have been completed on my Kindle. I'm not even sure I could do a best of. Maybe I should set myself a challenge for 2016?

### Songs

1. Flesh Without Blood – Grimes
- Can't Feel My Face – The Weeknd
- The Party Line – Belle & Sebastian

### Moments

1. Seeing parents for Christmas
- Getting to know the Third Rail bartenders
- No-holds-barred Walt Disney World trip
- MaxFunCon
