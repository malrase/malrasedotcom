People often asked for recommendations of bars to go to in New York. We've lived here just over four years, and I have a good handle on a few places I'd recommend.

Of course, the pandemic has (sadly) shuttered a number of my favourites - some for good, some temporarily. Some have moved digs, or turned into a pop-up while the situation is uncertain.

I thought I'd write down my list of great cocktail bars, February 2021 edition.

### Places that are open, with outdoor seating
- Raines Law Room (Chelsea)
- Death & Co (East Village)
- Amor Y Amargo - in a cool new location (East Village)

### Status Uncertain
- Jungle Bird (Chelsea) - their last post said early March
