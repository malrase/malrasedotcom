- [Saramago, Jos√©](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saramago) - [Blindness](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blindness_(novel\)) - 8.0
- [Thompson, Hunter S](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunter_S._Thompson) - [Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fear_and_Loathing_in_Las_Vegas) - 8.2
- [Updike, John](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Updike) - [Rabbit, Run](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rabbit,_Run) - 6.8

Two things. First, I really didn't understand Rabbit, Run and I need to find someone who's read that (and preferably the other ones in the series) to discuss it with.

Second, I'm almost there! Just four more letters left. I think I'll make it before 2014 starts. I must admit, this challenge wasn't as satisfying as War and Peace. It's been good to get to some new authors, but I've found myself wanting to stray too much. At least with War and Peace I could still read other books.
