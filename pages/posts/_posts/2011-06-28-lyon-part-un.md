I haven't visited many cities in France. Honestly, I'm a bit lazy. I think, "Why would you want to go anywhere other than Paris?"

However! Hampton was invited to a conference in Lyon ([Ruby Lugdunum](http://rulu.eu/), named after the Roman moniker for the town). As we were mostly either at the conference or eating, I didn't get a chance to look around most of the city. But I'm still going to judge it based on what I did see.

The hotel was pretty damn good, actually. It was called [Hotel Mercure](http://www.mercure.com/fr/hotel-7236-mercure-lyon-brotteaux/index.shtml). They had a nice French breakfast every morning (mmm, croissants). It was pretty central, and the staff were nice.

Lyon itself was much more of a city-city than Paris. Sometimes when you're in Paris, it's difficult to imagine someone actually living there. Lyon is a bustling place, with very few tourists. It feels like a financial centre.

The architecture was odd. I guess the city had mostly grown in the 60s/70s. There was lots of brutalist stuff - not that I'm complaining, as I love the [béton](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%C3%A9ton_brut) look. [The Université Lyon 1](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claude_Bernard_University_Lyon_1) (where the conference was held) was made up pretty much exclusively of this stuff.

Although the buildings were interesting, they'd been left to a surprising amount of decay. Paint peeling, weeds growing everywhere. It was pretty strange.

Oh, and on the topic of architecture, LYS had an awesome [train station](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gare_de_Lyon_Saint-Exup%C3%A9ry), designed by Santiago Calatrava.

It was super-easy to use the city's transportation. The metro is neat and seems to go to all the major places in the city.
