## Myths

### 1. Tech assholes are everywhere



### 2. It's a "gay" city

San Francisco certainly has a reputation for being a home of the modern gay rights movement. It's certainly a welcoming city for LGBT individuals, but I was expecting .

The LGBT aspects of San Francisco are pretty much concentrated in one area: the Castro. (There's some stuff in SOMA, too.) That's where you'll find the gay bars, .

### 3. It's foggy all the time/the weather sucks

Due to the microclimates in San Francisco, the weather is extremely variable. That means that some parts of the city can be foggy, overcast, or even rainy – while others are enjoying beautiful sunshine.

## Sad Truths

### 1. Bars don't play good music


### 2. Lines for everything


### 3. There is a homeless problem


### 4. The woo-woo flim-flam
