The last couple of years, I've participated in pools for the Academy Awards. I like the Oscars anyway, but competing against other people to see who can guess the most winners adds an extra level of excitement.

In preparation for this year, and to learn a bit of Rails, I decided to make my own pool site. It's found at [pool.malrase.com](http://pool.malrase.com).

It costs $15 to enter and there's some more rules on the site. I'd love for you to sign up, submit a ballot, and follow along with the 87th Academy Awards on the 22nd February!
