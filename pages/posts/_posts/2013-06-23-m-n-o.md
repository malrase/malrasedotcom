- [Morrison, Toni](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toni_Morrison) - [The Bluest Eye](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bluest_Eye) - 7.6/10
- [Naipaul, V.S.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V._S._Naipaul) - [A House for Mr Biswas](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_House_for_Mr._Biswas) - 8.3/10
- [O'Brien, Flann](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flann_O%27Brien) - [At Swim-Two-Birds](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/At_Swim-Two-Birds) - 2.1/10 °

As I'm just over half-way through the alphabet, I'm going to do a top five books so far:

1. I, Claudius - Graves
- A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius - Eggers
- Dubliners - Joyce
- Under the Skin - Faber
- In Cold Blood - Capote

° I couldn't even finish it. I made it to the half-way point, then had to stop. The book is supposed to be (partly) a take on Joyce, but I found the obfuscated narrative unreadable. Maybe this is what Finnegan's Wake is like?
