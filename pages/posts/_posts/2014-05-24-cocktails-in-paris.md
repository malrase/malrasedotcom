Living in San Francisco, we're spoiled when it comes to cocktails. Almost any bar you wander into could make a half-decent manhattan or gimlet. As [I've brought up before](/blog/2014/05/13/linz), cocktails in Europe are a little lacking. Hampton and I wanted to find some decent mixed drinks, so did some research on the cocktail scene in Paris. 

There are a handful of well-rated places, and we learnt that the first high-end cocktail bar to be successful was the [Experimental Cocktail Club](https://www.facebook.com/pages/Experimental-Cocktail-Club/129531980432588) ("ECC"), which has been open for about six years. Apparently, a number of trainee bartenders from there have spread across the city, opening their own high-end cocktail bars. We went to three (alas, we didn't make it to the ECC).

We ended up at the similarly-named [Prescription Cocktail Club](http://www.prescriptioncocktailclub.com/), in the [Saint Germain quarter](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Prescription+Cocktail+Club/@48.854997,2.337909,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x0:0x9d147b310bda215), as it was close to one of our favourite restaurants in Paris ([Fish la Boissonnerie](http://www.yelp.com/biz/fish-la-boissonnerie-paris-2)). There was no obvious sign from the street that it was a cocktail bar, but we were pretty sure we had the right address. We peered in a window and saw a bunch of people sipping cocktails, so we went in. Although we showed up at 9pm on a Friday, we were lucky enough to get a table. The service was pretty good (there was table service at every bar we went to), and the cocktails were competent. I ordered something with gin, green Chartreuse, and crème de menthe. It was a little too sweet for my taste, but drinkable nontheless.

[Mary Celeste](http://www.lemaryceleste.com/) was another bar we went to. It had pretty good cocktails and some tasty-looking tapas – we'd just eaten so we'll have to go back for the food.

The bizarrely-named [Sherry Butt](http://www.sherrybuttparis.com/), [not far from Bastille](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Sherry+Butt/@48.853303,2.364085,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x47e671ffaa10ef7d:0x2b98a01f163bffd1), was probably my favourite cocktail bar that we went to. We went on a Thursday night and it was really quiet (being quiet is definitely a bonus for us). The bar was set up like a workshop – unfinished wood tables and odd contraptions on shelves. The menu was inventive and they seemed to produce a lot of their own syrups and flavourings for their drinks. Although they only listed their own concoctions, I asked for a Last Word and the bartender didn't hesitate to make one. The bartender was super-friendly and explained to us the cocktail scene in Paris – about how the "ECC" started it all, and that most of the high-end bartenders originated there. He was surprised we hadn't been to Candelaria, and strongly recommended we go there next.

[Candelaria](http://www.candelariaparis.com/), just [south of République](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Candelaria/@48.862981,2.364034,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x0:0xfe5e1d4c40b38ec0), is a pretty strange place. It reminded me of something you'd find in San Francisco. From the street, it's a tiny, bright taqueria. There's one table and a handful of seats at a bar. At 9pm on a Thursday night, it was packed. People were spilling out onto the street, and we were told it would be a 30min wait if we wanted food. However, we were there for the cocktails.

If you squeeze past the people sitting at the diner-style bar, there's an unmarked door. Go through it and you're in a much larger room – although equally busy – lit by candles. The space was decorated with Day-of-the-Dead style skeletons and it really did feel like we were back in the Mission. Unfortunately, the cocktails were mediocre. We hadn't reserved a table ahead, so we were stuck standing elbow-to-elbow with the hipsters of Paris. It was a little clostrophobic in there.

We went to another cocktail bar/tapas restaurant nearby Candelaria: [Le Mary Celeste](http://www.lemaryceleste.com/cocktails/). As far as I know, the bartenders weren't ECC alumni, but they had a neat cocktail menu. The bar had a vaguely nautical theme, and the cocktails were refreshing – both on-menu and classics like a manhattan or a gimlet. If you're in the area, and want to get away from the intensity of Candelaria, I'd say it's a good call.

It's worth pointing out that cocktails in Paris are expensive. €13 (~US$18) was not unusual. Compare that to cocktails in San Francisco, where anything more than $12 would be considered pricey. It's a trade-off, obviously – the price of a baguette (80¢ or ~US$1.10) or some great cheese is way less in Paris than in San Francisco.

I'm happy we found these places. Most were a little tricky to track down, but fun to drink at. It's good to know there are decent cocktial bars in Paris – even if you have to walk down a weird side-alley to get to them. I look forward to finding more next time we're in the city.
