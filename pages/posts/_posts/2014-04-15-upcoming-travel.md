For the next seven months, Hampton and I will be travelling around Europe and the East Coast. We have few solid plans aside from some conferences ([Codefront.io](http://codefront.io/), [La Conf](http://2014.la-conf.org/), [HybridConf](http://hybridconf.net/) and [SassConf](http://sassconf.com/)).

A friend gave me the idea to blog as we travel. I've been lax with this blog recently, and I hope that switching platforms (from WordPress to Octopress) will spur me to write more.
