If you've been following [my Twitter](https://twitter.com/malrase) over the past few Sundays, you might have noticed I post a Game of Thrones themed cocktail. Some are better than others, and some I put more effort into (the Blood on the Snow is basically a G&T – I was on beach vacation for that one).

Some people said they'd be interested in seeing a list with recipes. So here you go: my Game of Thrones cocktails.
