I've seen a lot of people talk about how difficult 2014 was for them, and I must admit, it's been a pretty stressful year for me too. From quitting my job to putting on a conference to the Mozilla stuff and then travelling for seven months... it's been hectic.

I've visited four new countries (Netherlands, Czech Republic, Austria and Mexico), stayed in many new cities (Prague, Stockholm, Vienna, Philadelphia, Raleigh, and Los Angeles – to name a few), and far too many airports.

I'm definitely looking forward to this upcoming year. It's filled with a lot of promise.

Here's some of the things I've enjoyed this year.
