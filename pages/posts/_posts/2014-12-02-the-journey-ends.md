I'm writing this on a plane. We're travelling back to San Francisco after seven months of being away from home. Here are some fun facts about our trip.

- 226 days on the road
- 10 countries (with seven languages) visited
- 21 airports (SFO, IAD, DCA, ATL, JAX, PHL, CDG, VIE, AGP, LPL, STN, PRG, AMS, SXF, TXL, ARN, LHR, EWR, YTZ, JFK, DFW)
- 10 [UNESCO World Heritage](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Heritage_Site) sites ([Alhambra](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alhambra), [Kutn√° Hora](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kutn%C3%A1_Hora), [Historic Centre of Prague](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_World_Heritage_Sites_in_the_Czech_Republic), [Tower of London](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_of_London), [Westminster](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palace_of_Westminster), the [Canals of Amsterdam](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canals_of_Amsterdam), [Historic Centre of Vienna](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vienna), the [Banks of the Seine](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seine), [Independence Hall](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence_Hall), and [Monticello](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monticello))
- 41 films watched (3 on a plane, 14 in the cinema, [1 with mostly Czech subtitles so I didn't really know what was going on](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dawn_of_the_Planet_of_the_Apes))
- 8 conferences attended
- 2 birthdays celebrated
- 1 Kindle lost

Looking back, it's certainly been a lot of fun. But it's also been pretty stressful. At least, I remember it being stressful at the time. Already the rosiness of hindsight is taking over and I almost wish I was back travelling again.

*Almost* wish. I'm not leaving my couch for a while.
