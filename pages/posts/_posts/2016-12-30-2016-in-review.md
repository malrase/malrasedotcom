It's been a rough year. Globally – but also personally. My home country and my adoptive country appear to be falling apart. The international uncertainty around Brexit and the election of a demagogue in the U.S. makes me wonder what 2017 has in store. Closer to home, we've had a strange year. We started and ended the year looking for jobs – and in between worked at a startup with people who I respected and enjoyed working with thoroughly.

We're starting 2017 with new jobs, in New York. It's a big move, but one we've wanted to make for a while. We're sad to be leaving San Francisco, and excited to see what New York has in store for us.

Anyway, onto my lists. I feel like we've had a bumper year in terms of film, TV, and music. It was a lot tougher picking a top three for most things I had last year – so I separated out TV and music into two categories apiece.

### Films

1. 10 Cloverfield Lane
2. The Witch
3. Arrival

Honourable mentions: Green Room and Captain America: Civil War.

### TV

I enjoyed a lot of TV this year. So much so that I split the TV section up into two: episodes and shows. I couldn't pick a favourite episode from the shows listed.

#### Episodes

1. Battle of the Bastards (Game of Thrones, S06 E09)
2. The Bicameral Mind (Westworld, S01 E10)
3. Mulder and Scully Meet the Were-Monster (X-Files, S10 E03)

#### Shows

1. American Crime Story: The People vs OJ Simpson
2. Stranger Things
3. The Crown

### Books

Again, I've been terrible with reading.

### Albums

We've been spoiled this year with great albums from great artists. This list is pretty standard, but here you go.

1. A Moon Shaped Pool – Radiohead
2. Lemonade – Beyoncé
3. Blackstar – David Bowie

### Songs

I tried to pick songs off albums not on my best-of list. Otherwise, Burn the Witch and Formation would be numbers 1 and 2.

1. Ivy – Frank Ocean
2. Ugo – Dead Pirates
3. Nobody Speak – DJ Shadow feat. Run the Jewels
