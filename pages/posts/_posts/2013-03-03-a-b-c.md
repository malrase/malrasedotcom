Last year I read [War and Peace](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_and_peace) - it has 365 chapters, so fit neatly into one year at a chapter a day. It was nice having a challenge to finish such an epic book and gave me a reason to read every day.

I needed to come up with a challenge for 2013 (although it'll probably spill into 2014). After writing down a list of books I wanted to read, I noticed that there was a string of authors with surnames starting with consecutive letters of the alphabet. I started expanding the list to fit other letters. The only rule is that I can't have read the author before.

So, this is the start of the A-Z Book Challenge. My first three books were [Money](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Money_(novel\)) by [Martin Amis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Amis), [Labyrinths](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labyrinths) by [Jorge Luis Borges](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borges), and [In Cold Blood](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_Cold_Blood) by [Truman Capote](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truman_Capote).

My favourite was probably Money. It was interesting and fun to read an author who has been influential to other authors I've read in ways I didn't realise. The central character, John Self, was one of the strongest and most fascinating narrators I've read in a while.

Labyrinths took me a while to get into. I don't know if it's because I've come across a lot of the ideas presented in other ways (e.g. science fiction movies), but some of the stories resonated. In particular, I loved [The Form of the Sword](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Shape_of_the_Sword), [The Garden of Forking Paths](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Garden_of_Forking_Paths) and [Pierre Menard, Author of the Quixote](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_Menard,_Author_of_the_Quixote). The last one in particular stuck with me, for some reason - maybe its relevance to copyright, plagiarism, etc. and the internet?

In Cold Blood was great. I went through it surprisingly fast - it was an easy read. I understand it's probably more fiction than fact, but Perry Smith was a seriously likeable character(/person?).

Anyway, next up: The Book of Daniel by E. L. Doctorow.
