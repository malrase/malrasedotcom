Our first major stop in Europe has been Paris. We're staying in an area new to us: [la Butte-aux-Cailles](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butte-aux-Cailles). It's in the [13th arrondissement](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/13th_arrondissement_of_Paris) of Paris, in the south-east of the city. 

The neighbourhood has a small-town feel, and isn't touristy at all. I've only encountered other English-speakers when I've left the area. It's fairly easy to get to other places, as the nearby [Place d'Italie](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Place_d'Italie) has a number of lines from its Métro stop.

There are a decent number of bars, cafés and restaurants on [the main street](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Rue+de+la+Butte+aux+Cailles/@48.8277143,2.3498739,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x47e67190f05e1315:0x4771112c8d0bf60b). From about 6pm to midnight, they're packed with people – so much so, that there's often a crowd spilling out onto the street. It's a little strange for a neighbourhood that's fairly quiet the rest of the time.

Anyway, the thing that struck me the most about the area was that it seems to have a large amount of street art (apparently [Paris is becoming the "center of street art"](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-03-26/how-overprotective-paris-became-the-center-of-street-art-.html)). Every wall seems to have something beautiful or provocative on it. 

The most famous (as far as I can tell) street art in the area is done by [Sampsa](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampsa_(street_artist\)), the "Finnish Banksy."

</div>

The two pieces by Sampsa were in protest of the [HADOPI law](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HADOPI_law) – a copyright infringement law from around 2009. Amusingly, the first logo for the HADOPI agency used [a typeface without appropriate licensing](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/france/6974249/Anti-piracy-agencys-logo-broke-copyright.html).

  <div class="alt">The blood sucking HADOPI</div>
</div>

The mosquito art was [censored for a while](http://motherboard.vice.com/blog/paris-censored-anti-copyright-street-art) – removing the "Blood sucking HADOPI" line. But apparently it has been recently restored.

There are a bunch artworks done in mostly muted blues and greys. They're all of children. At first glance, they're kind of peaceful.

However when I started to study them there was something unnerving about them. The children never had faces.

</div>

As well as the lack of faces, the children are usually disappearing. They're walking through a waterfall or curtain into another world. Or they're being partially submerged. They're a little eerie.

[Miss.tic](http://www.missticinparis.com/) is another artist with a lot of works in the area. According to [her biography page](http://www.missticinparis.com/misstic_biographie.html), she's almost 60 years old. She has a bunch of stencils that tend to be of provocatively-posed ladies with humourous or ironic captions.

I've done my best to translate the captions, but they'll no doubt be a little off. If anyone wants to correct me, please do!

Miss.tic doesn't only do scantily-clad ladies, though.

There are a couple of sculptures by the Italian street art group [UrbanSolid](http://www.urbansolid.org/).

I liked these, although the prisoner is just around a tight corner, and at night I keep thinking there's a person waiting there. It's a little creepy.

There are a few pieces by [Jana und JS](http://www.janaundjs.com/). They have a nice style, and do work in a number of European cities. I like their focus on photography/photographers, who appear in a lot of their works.

You may have noticed a small gecko logo next to a lot of the art. I'm not 100% sure what the symbol is for – looking up the [Lézarts de la Bièvre](http://www.lezarts-bievre.com/), it seems to be some kind of art event held in June, with a focus on street artists.

Finally, here's a bunch of other neat stuff I saw that seemed to be one-offs by artists (at least, one-offs for this area).

Anyway, I [google-mapped](https://www.google.com/maps/dir/48.8310625,2.3552585/48.8280933,2.3526657/48.8266199,2.3479307/48.8290213,2.3478663/48.8288321,2.3507471/48.8310907,2.3552156/@48.8292438,2.3512191,17z/data=!4m8!4m7!1m0!1m0!1m0!1m0!1m0!1m0!3e2) (Is "google-map" a verb? It is now, I guess) the route I took. It starts and ends at Place d'Italie, in case you're arriving by Métro, and takes about 30 minutes. Of course, just wandering around the neighbourhood – especially on a Sunday morning, when it's super-quiet – is nice too.

We're leaving this area in the next couple of days to move to a hotel for [La Conf](http://2014.la-conf.org/). After that, it's off to [Málaga](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C3%A1laga) to meet my family.
