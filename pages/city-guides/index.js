      <h1>City Guides</h1>
      <div>
      <p>There are a few cities that I've become familiar with â€“ through frequent travel or living there for a while. Through that, I've either written a number of blog posts or just know a few places I'd recommend. </p>

      <p>I decided to collate a lot of this information into city guides. Each guide acts as a collection of any blog posts as well as broad overall tips on the city, where I've enjoyed eating, and, most importantly, <b>good drinking spots</b>.</p>

      <p>Hopefully this list will grow as I spend more time in various cities.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>London (coming soon!)</li>
        <li>Paris</li>
        <li>Prague</li>
        <li>San Francisco - Dogpatch</li>
